# About me

Hi, I'm Sean. I'm a data scientist with an interest in using data wrangling and feature engineering to get as much out of a dataset as possible. The main tools I have experience with are Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

I went to Georgia College and State University to study physics where I gained a strong theoretical understanding of mathematics, specifically with linear algebra. After graduating I decided not to pursue a career in research, so I began to study Python to become a programmer. This led me to find Lambda School where I decided to specialize in data science. At Lambda School I learned the foundations of data engineering and machine learning. I also worked with multiple teams of developers to implement data science models into web applications. I'm looking forward to joining a full-time data science team in order to learn more industry-standard technologies and solve more complex problems using data. 

Outside of data science, I am an active member of the Super Smash Brothers Melee community. In college, I was the president of the Smash club where I ran weekly tournaments and set up a stream to broadcast the matches online. Now, I spend my free time practicing, watching, and analyzing the game as well as competing in local and regional tournaments.

# Projects
### C4ADS Arms Exporters

This project involved working with the Center for Advanced Defence Studies to use trade data and a list of known arms exporters to try to predict new companies selling military weapons. One of my colaborators Elliot Gunn published an article on Towards Data Science that I will link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-machine-learning-to-tackle-arms-proliferation-in-russian-trade-data-e457f44002c0?source=friends_link&sk=b99118751e39eb7edd42a318c40854ee).

### Simpsons Says

Simpsons Says is an endpoint which uses TFIDF vectorization to find a quote from The Simpsons that is similar to user input text. To input text add it to the end of the url. If no text is added a random quote will be returned. In order to get the model small enough to deploy on heroku the vocabulary was reduced to 300 words so results may not be perfect.

### US Energy Generation

This is a Plotly Dash app that vizualizes energy data from the ESA to show how much electricity is produced from different sources over the last couple decades in the United States.
