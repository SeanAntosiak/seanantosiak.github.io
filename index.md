# About me

Hi, I'm Sean. I'm a data scientist with an interest in using data wrangling and feature engineering to get as much out of a dataset as possible. The main tools I am currently working with are Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

I studied physics at Georgia College and State University where I gained a strong theoretical understanding of mathematics, specifically with linear algebra. After graduating I decided not to pursue a career in research, so I began to study Python to become a programmer. This led me to find Lambda School where I decided to specialize in data science. At Lambda School I learned the foundations of data engineering and machine learning. I also worked with multiple teams of developers to implement data science models into web applications. I'm looking forward to learning new industry-standard technologies to solve more complex problems using data.

Outside of data science, I am an active member of the Super Smash Brothers Melee community. In college, I was the president of the Smash club where I ran weekly tournaments and set up a stream to broadcast the matches online. Now, in my free time, I practice, watch, and analyze the game as well as compete in local and regional tournaments.


# Projects
### C4ADS Arms Exporters (Remote internship)

This project involved working with the Center for Advanced Defence Studies to use trade data and a list of known arms exporters to try to predict new companies selling military weapons. One of my colaborators on this project, Elliot Gunn, published an article on Towards Data Science that I will link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-machine-learning-to-tackle-arms-proliferation-in-russian-trade-data-e457f44002c0?source=friends_link&sk=b99118751e39eb7edd42a318c40854ee).

### Simpsons Says (Team Project)

Simpsons Says is an endpoint which uses TFIDF vectorization to find a quote from The Simpsons that is similar to user input text. To input text add it to the end of the url. If no text is added a random quote will be returned. Quotes are returned in JSON format and include the character who said the quote. In order to get the model small enough to deploy on heroku the vocabulary was reduced to 300 words. As a result the returned quote may not be perfect.

### US Energy Generation (Personal Project)

This is a Plotly Dash app that vizualizes energy data from the ESA to show how much electricity is produced from some of the most used energy sources over the last couple decades in the United States.
